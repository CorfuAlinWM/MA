    of McAlister’s Franchisor SPV LLC 5620 Glenridge Drive NE, Atlanta, GA 30342 (“<strong>Sponsor</strong>”), which

    promotion, or offer.
</p>
<p>
    All entries must be received by the end of the Promotion Period in order to participate. The Sponsor’s database
    clock will be the official time keeper for this Sweepstakes. Except as otherwise contemplated in these Official
    Rules, and to the extent entrants may otherwise elect at the time of entry, personal information collected in
    connection with the Sweepstakes will be used in accordance with Sponsor’s privacy policy located at
   <a href="../privacy.html">https://www.mcalistersdeli.com/privacy</a>. Sponsor may engage third party application providers and other vendors to
    administer certain aspects of the Sweepstakes, including without limitation, the online collection of entry
    information. Such third parties will provide your personally identifiable information to Sponsor, who except as set
    forth herein will use such information in accordance with its online privacy policy, located at
    <a href="../privacy.html">https://www.mcalistersdeli.com/privacy</a> and such third parties may also use your information for their own
    independent purposes in accordance with their own independent privacy practices. Sponsor is not responsible for the
    storage or any use of your entry information by such third parties.
</p>
<p>
    Entries made by any other individual or any entity, and/or originating at any other web site or e-mail address,
    including but not limited to commercial sweepstakes subscription notification and/or entering service sites, will be
    declared invalid and disqualified for this Sweepstakes. Tampering with the entry process or the operation of the
    Sweepstakes, including but not limited to the use of any device to automate the entry process, is prohibited and any
    entries deemed by Sponsor, in its sole discretion, to have been submitted in this manner will be void. In the event
    a dispute regarding the identity of the individual who actually submitted an entry cannot be resolved to Sponsor’s
    satisfaction, the affected entry may be deemed ineligible. The Promotion Entities shall not be responsible for
    incorrect or inaccurate entry information whether caused by Internet users or by any of the equipment or programming
    associated with or utilized in the Sweepstakes or by any technical or human error which may occur in the processing
    of the entries in the Sweepstakes. The Promotion Entities assume no responsibility or liability for any error,
    omission, interruption, deletion, theft or destruction, or unauthorized access to, or alteration of entries.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>WINNER SELECTION AND NOTIFICATION:</strong> At the end of the Promotion Period, the winners will be randomly selected in a
    drawing from all eligible entries received throughout the Promotion Period. The drawing will be conducted by Sponsor
    or its designee, using randomization methods selected by Sponsor in its sole discretion. A potential winner will be
    notified by telephone and/or mail and/or e-mail using the contact information given at the time of entry. Sponsor
    shall have no liability for any winner notification that is lost, intercepted or not received by a potential winner
    for any reason. If, despite reasonable efforts, a potential winner does not respond within forty-eight (48) hours of
    the first notification attempt, or if the prize or prize notification is returned as unclaimed or undeliverable to
    such potential winner, such potential winner will forfeit his or her prize and an alternate winner may be selected.
    If any potential winner is found to be ineligible, or if he or she has not complied with these Official Rules or
    declines a prize for any reason prior to award, such potential winner will be disqualified and an alternate winner
    may be selected. Sponsor may successively attempt to contact up to two (2) potential winner(s) of an applicable
    prize in accordance with such procedure, and if there is still no confirmed winner(s) of such applicable prize after
    such attempts have been made, if any, such prize may go unawarded.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>PUBLICITY RELEASE:</strong> By participating in the Sweepstakes, in addition to any other grants which may be granted in any
    other agreement entered into between Sponsor and any entrant in and/or winner of the Sweepstakes, each entrant
    irrevocably grants the Promotion Entities and their respective successors, assigns and licensees, the right to use
    such entrant’s name, likeness, and biographical information, and any other personal characteristics, in any and all
    media for any purpose, including without limitation, advertising and promotional purposes, the Sweepstakes or other
    promotions, and each entrant and/or prize winner(s) hereby release the Promotion Entities from any liability with
    respect thereto.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>PRIZES/ODDS:</strong> There are ten (10) prizes available. There are five (5) prizes available for Nominated Teachers and
    five (5) prizes available for Nominated Nurses. Each prize consists of a catering valued at Two Hundred Dollars
    ($200.00), valid at participating local McAlister’s Deli restaurants in the United States. Each prize will be
    available for collection through coordination with local McAlister’s Deli restaurants closest to winners’ residence
    and will be valid for a period of (30) days from the date of delivery. Prizes will expire if not redeemed. Prizes
    cannot be combined with any other discounts, coupons, or offers. The approximate retail value (“<strong>ARV</strong>”) for each prize
    is: Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00). Total ARV of all prizes awarded in this Sweepstakes is Two Thousand Dollars
    ($2,000.00). Prizes will be awarded to the entrant who submitted the nomination for delivery to the Nominated Nurse
    or Nominated Teacher.
</p>
<p>
    No cash alternative or substitution of prizes will be allowed, except Sponsor reserves the right in its sole
    discretion to substitute prize(s) of comparable value if any prize listed is unavailable, in whole or in part, for
    any reason. Applicable portions of prizes will be delivered only to an address in the United States.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Actual odds of winning depend on the number of eligible entries received.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>GENERAL PRIZE CONDITIONS:</strong> Prizes will be awarded only if each potential prize winner fully complies with these
    Official Rules. All portions of the prize(s) are non-assignable and non-transferable. Prizes pictured in
    point-of-sale, online, television and print advertising, promotional packaging, and other Sweepstakes materials are
    for illustrative purposes only. Actual prize(s) may vary from the prize(s) pictured. All details and other
    restrictions of the prize(s) not specified in these Official Rules will be determined by Sponsor in its sole
    discretion. No cash alternative or substitution of the prize(s) will be allowed, except Sponsor reserves the right
    in its sole discretion to substitute prize(s) of comparable value if any prize listed is unavailable, in whole or in
    part, for any reason. Each prize winner shall be solely responsible for all federal, state and/or local taxes, and
    the reporting consequences thereof, and for any other fees or costs associated with the applicable prize. Sponsor
    may, in its sole discretion, deduct or withhold the amount of applicable tax on any cash or cash equivalent prize.
    The Sponsor will issue and file an IRS Form 1099 or equivalent tax withholding documentation for the retail value of
    any prize or other items of value transferred to each prize winner by the Sponsor in accordance with IRS
    requirements, and the Sponsor may also share such documentation with a state or local government agency as required
    by law. Refusal or failure of each prize winner to satisfy the requirements of all necessary and appropriate tax,
    withholding or other required compliance terms (including Social Security number, IRS Form W­8BEN, IRS Form W­9, or
    equivalent information), as determined by the Sponsor in its sole discretion, may result in each prize winner
    forfeiting the prize(s) and an alternate potential winner may be selected in accordance with these Official Rules.
    Sponsor will award prizes subject to any applicable withholding taxes, and the amount of the prize transferred, as
    reduced by any applicable withholding taxes, will constitute full payment of the prize, as applicable. Each
    potential winner will be required to execute an Affidavit of Eligibility, a Liability Release, and (where imposing
    such condition is legal) a Publicity Release (collectively, “<strong>Prize Claim Documents</strong>”). If a winner is under the age
    of majority in such winner’s state of residence (a “<strong>minor</strong>”), at Sponsor’s option, the applicable prize either will
    be awarded in the name of the parent or legal guardian of such minor winner, or the parent or legal guardian of such
    minor winner will be required to ratify and sign Prize Claim Documents. If any potential winner (or, in the case of
    a minor, such minor winner’s parent or legal guardian) fails or refuses to sign and return all Prize Claim Documents
    within ten (10) days of prize notification, the winner may be disqualified and an alternate winner may be selected.
</p>
<p>
    Sponsor makes no warranties, and hereby disclaims any and all warranties, express or implied, concerning any prize
    furnished in connection with the Sweepstakes. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, SUCH PRIZES ARE
        PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND SPONSOR HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL SUCH
        WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE AND/OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>GENERAL LIABILITY RELEASE/FORCE MAJEURE:</strong> Acceptance of a prize constitutes winner’s permission for the Promotion
    Entities to use winner’s name, photograph, likeness, voice, biographical information, statements and address (city
    and state) for advertising and/or publicity purposes worldwide and in all forms of media now known or hereafter
    developed, in perpetuity, without further compensation. Each entrant (and any minor entrant’s parent or legal
    guardian) agrees that Sponsor (A) shall not be responsible or liable for, and are hereby released from, any and all
    costs, injuries, losses or damages of any kind, including, without limitation, death and bodily injury, due in whole
    or in part, directly or indirectly, to participation in the Sweepstakes or any Sweepstakes-related activity, or from
    entrants’ acceptance, receipt, possession and/or use or misuse of any prize, and (B) have not made any warranty,
    representation or guarantee express or implied, in fact or in law, with respect to any prize, including, without
    limitation, to such prize’s quality or fitness for a particular purpose. Sponsor assumes no responsibility for any
    damage to an entrant’s, or any other person’s, computer system which is occasioned by accessing the Website or
    otherwise participating in the Sweepstakes, or for any computer system, phone line, hardware, software or program
    malfunctions, or other errors, failures, delayed computer transmissions or network connections that are human or
    technical in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Sponsor is not responsible for incomplete,
    illegible, misdirected, misprinted, late, lost, damaged, stolen, or postage-due entries or prize notifications; or
    for lost, interrupted, inaccessible or unavailable networks, servers, satellites, Internet service providers,
    websites, or other connections; or for miscommunications, failed, jumbled, scrambled, delayed, or misdirected
    computer, telephone or cable transmissions; or for any technical malfunctions, failures, difficulties or other
    errors of any kind or nature; or for the incorrect or inaccurate capture of information, or the failure to capture
    any information. Sponsor reserves the right in its sole discretion to disqualify any individual who is found to be
    tampering with the entry process or the operation of the Sweepstakes or the Website, to be acting in violation of
    these Official Rules, or to be acting in an unsportsman-like or disruptive manner, or with the intent to disrupt or
    undermine the legitimate operation of the Sweepstakes, or to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass any other person, and
    Sponsor reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from any such person to the fullest extent permitted
    by law. No mechanically reproduced, illegible, incomplete, forged, software-generated or other automated multiple
    entries will be accepted. If a dispute as to the identity of the individual who actually submitted an entry cannot
    be resolved to Sponsor’s satisfaction, the affected entry may be deemed ineligible. Sponsor reserves the right to
    modify, extend, suspend, or terminate the Sweepstakes if it determines, in its sole discretion, that the Sweepstakes
    is technically impaired or corrupted or that fraud or technical problems, failures or malfunctions or other causes
    beyond Sponsor’s control have destroyed or severely undermined or to any degree impaired the integrity,
    administration, security, proper play and/or feasibility of the Sweepstakes as contemplated herein. In the event an
    insufficient number of eligible entries are received and/or Sponsor is prevented from awarding prizes or continuing
    with the Sweepstakes as contemplated herein by any event beyond its control, including but not limited to fire,
    flood, earthquake, windstorm, epidemic, pandemic, public health crisis, disease, virus, sickness or outbreak or
    other similar or dissimilar natural disaster; act of God or public enemy; riot or civil disturbance, act of any
    government or governmental authority, power failure, satellite or equipment failure, failure of telecommunications
    lines or failure or breakdown of plant, machinery or vehicles operated by a third party; labor dispute, strike, or
    lockout; actual or threat of war, armed conflict, terrorist attacks, war (declared, undeclared or threatened),
    explosion, nuclear, or chemical or biological contamination; or a government imposed travel ban, restriction on
    movement or gatherings, or other government imposed mandate of any kind, order of any court or jurisdiction, or
    other cause not reasonably within Sponsor’s control (each a “<strong>Force Majeure</strong>” event or occurrence), then subject to
    any governmental approval which may be required, Sponsor reserves the right to modify, suspend, or terminate the
    Sweepstakes. If the Sweepstakes is terminated before the designated end date, Sponsor may (if possible) select the
    winners in a random drawing from all eligible, non-suspect entries received as of the date of the event giving rise
    to the termination. Inclusion in such drawing shall be each entrant’s sole and exclusive remedy under such
    circumstances. Only the type and quantity of prizes described in these Official Rules will be awarded. If, for any
    reason, more bona fide winners come forward seeking to claim prizes in excess of the number of each type of prize
    set forth in these Official Rules, the winners, or remaining winners, as the case may be, of the advertised number
    of prizes available in the prize category in question may be selected in a random drawing from among all persons
    making purportedly valid claims for such prize(s). Inclusion in such drawing shall be each entrant’s sole and
    exclusive remedy under such circumstances. These Official Rules cannot be modified or amended in any way except in a
    written document issued in accordance with law by a duly authorized representative of Sponsor. The invalidity or
    unenforceability of any provision of these Official Rules shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any
    other provision. If any provision is determined to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable or illegal, these Official
    Rules shall otherwise remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with their terms as if the invalid or
    illegal provision were not contained herein.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>GOVERNING LAW/JURISDICTION:</strong> ALL ISSUES AND QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY, INTERPRETATION AND
    ENFORCEABILITY OF THESE OFFICIAL RULES OR THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF ENTRANTS OR SPONSOR IN CONNECTION WITH THE
    SWEEPSTAKES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA WITHOUT
    GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CHOICE OF LAW OF CONFLICT OF LAW RULES OR PROVISIONS THAT WOULD CAUSE THE APPLICATION OF ANY
    OTHER STATE’S LAWS.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>ARBITRATION PROVISION:</strong><br />
    By participating in this Sweepstakes, each entrant (and any minor entrant’s parent or legal guardian) agrees: (i)
    that any and all disputes the entrant may have with, or claims entrant may have against, the Promotion Entities
    relating to, arising out of or connected in any way with (a) the Sweepstakes, (b) the awarding or redemption of any
    prize, and/or (c) the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, will be resolved
    exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by JAMS and conducted before a sole arbitrator in
    accordance with the rules of JAMS; (ii) this arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving
    interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“<strong>FAA</strong>”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16; (iii) the
    arbitration shall be held in Atlanta, Georgia; (iv) the arbitrator’s decision shall be controlled by the terms and
    conditions of these Official Rules and any of the other agreements referenced herein that the applicable entrant may
    have entered into in connection with the Sweepstakes; (v) the arbitrator shall apply Georgia law consistent with the
    FAA and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; (vi) there shall
    be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, arbitration can decide only
    entrant’s and/or Sponsor’s individual claims; the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons
    or parties who may be similarly situated; (vii) the arbitrator shall not have the power to award punitive damages
    against the entrant or Sponsor; (viii) if the entrant is able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be
    prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Sponsor will pay as much of entrant’s filing and hearing fees in
    connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being
    cost-prohibitive; and (ix) with the exception of subpart (vi) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is
    deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules of JAMS, then the balance of
    this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the
    invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, subpart (vi) is
    found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and
    void, and neither entrant nor Sponsor shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute. For more information on JAMS
    and/or the rules of JAMS, visit their website at <a href="http://jamsadr.com/">www.jamsadr.com</a>.
