<h2>Rewards and benefits</h2>
<p>
  The benefits that are available to you through McAlister’s Rewards Program are
  based on the number of "Points" that you earn. Members are limited to one
  redemption every four (4) hours (redemption wait period). Rewards codes can be
  sent via McAlister’s emails, push notifications, rich messages, SMS, or
  automatically added to McAlister’s Rewards Program member account. Offers live
  in member rewards account and can be accessed via the App or logging into your
  rewards account online. Members earn points by signing into rewards account on
  the App or online or by providing registered phone number at participating
  McAlister’s locations when making purchases for dine-in, carry-out or online
  orders (excluding the purchase of gift cards, alcohol and catering) at
  participating McAlister’s locations only. You will receive one (1) "Point" for
  each U.S. dollar spent, except during limited time promotions when McAlister’s
  may offer "Bonus Points" on featured products and/or services. No partial
  Points will be earned for purchase amounts less than one (1) U.S. dollar, with
  $0.51 minimum check-in amount.
</p>
<p>
  When you first sign up for McAlister’s Rewards Program, you will receive a
  reward offer of a free tea, redeemable at participating McAlister’s locations
  (the "Introductory Reward"). You will receive a reward offer of a free
  beverage or kid’s item on your next purchase for every 500 Points earned; a
  free cup of soup, side or dessert for every 1,000 points earned; and a free
  entrée with every 1,500 points earned in your McAlister’s Rewards Program
  account (each, a "Frequency Reward"). McAlister’s may also provide
  personalized reward offers through the McAlister’s Rewards Program terminal
  for McAlister’s Rewards Program participants ("Surprise and Delight Rewards").
  Surprise and Delight Rewards expire immediately if not used during the same
  McAlister’s Rewards Program session in which the offer first appears within
  the App. Two (2) weeks prior to your birthday (the birthday date of record
  that you provide to McAlister’s in your McAlister’s Rewards Program account),
  you will receive a special Surprise and Delight Reward to celebrate your
  birthday (not to be combined with other discounts or offers) (the "Birthday
  Reward"). The Birthday Reward will expire fourteen (14) days from your
  birthday. Limit 1 account per person, per device, per birthday, per email.
  Once the birthday is set, it cannot be changed. Other special reward offers
  may be distributed by email to you if you opt-in to receive promotional and
  marketing offers from McAlister’s and provide a valid email and telephone
  number in order to receive your special offers. Special offers may include
  periodic discounts on food, beverages, and merchandise. Special offers may
  have certain restrictions including expiration dates. Special offers are
  personal to you and cannot be shared, copied or transferred. You will be
  required to enter your phone number into the McAlister’s Rewards Program
  terminal in order to redeem special offers. Read each offer carefully for
  specific details, limitations and restrictions. Once you agree to redeem a
  reward by pressing the redemption button in the McAlister’s Rewards Program,
  it must be used immediately and cannot be credited back to your account.
</p>

  receive system and transaction emails related to your participation in

<h2>Binding dispute resolution and arbitration; class action waiver</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Please Read This Provision Carefully. It Affects Your Legal Rights,
    INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Last Update to this Binding Dispute Resolution and Arbitration; Class
    Action Waiver Section: January 1, 2020 This Binding Dispute Resolution and
    Arbitration; Class Action Waiver Provision (the “Provision”) facilitates the
    prompt and efficient resolution of any “dispute,” which includes any claim
    or controversy, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance,
    tort – including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent
    inducement, or negligence – or any other legal or equitable theory, and
    includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Provision (with the
    exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below)
    that may arise between you and McAlister’s that may arise out of or any way
    relate to your access of the App, your use of and participation in the
    McAlister’s Rewards Program, any other Rewards program described in this
    Terms and Conditions, and/or this Agreement, including the validity,
    enforceability or scope of this Provision (with the exception of the Class
    Action Waiver provision below). Effectively, then, “dispute” is given the
    broadest meaning enforceable by law and includes any claims against other
    parties relating to services or products provided or billed to you (such as
    McAlister’s licensors, suppliers, dealers or third-party vendors) whenever
    you also assert claims against McAlister’s in the same proceeding.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>This Provision provides that all disputes between you and McAlister’s shall
    be resolved by binding arbitration because acceptance of these Terms and
    Conditions constitutes a waiver of your right to litigation claims and all
    opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. McAlister’s prefers this because
    McAlister’s believes arbitration is less drama-filled than litigation. To be
    clear, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an
    arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow these Terms and
    Conditions and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including
    attorney’s fees). You may, however, opt-out of this Provision which means
    you would have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a
    judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in
    court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions). ALL PARTIES
    HERETO AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS
    DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS
    IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY
    BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS
    PROVISION.</strong>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <h2>Pre-arbitration claim resolution</h2>
    <p>
      For all Disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first
      give McAlister’s an opportunity to resolve the Dispute which is first done
      by visiting
      <a class="fcs-third-party" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://survey3.medallia.com/?mcalisters-contact-us&amp;br=5">www.mcalistersdeli.com/contact</a> and filling out the
      form: (1) Your name, (2) Your address, (3) A written description of your
      claim, and (4) A description of the specific relief you seek. If
      McAlister’s does not resolve the Dispute within 45 days after receiving
      your notification, than you may pursue your Dispute in arbitration. You
      may pursue your dispute in a court only under the circumstances described
      below.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2>Exclusions from arbitration/right to opt out</h2>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the above, you or McAlister’s may choose to pursue a
      Dispute in court and not by arbitration if: (a) The dispute qualifies for
      initiation in small claims court; or (b) YOU OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION
      PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THESE
      TERMS AND CONDITIONS (the “Opt-Out Deadline”). You may opt-out of this
      Provision by mailing McAlister’s at McAlister’s Franchisor SPV LLC, Attn:
      Legal Department, 5620 Glenridge Drive, Atlanta, GA 30342: (1) Your name;
      (2) Your address; (3) A clear statement that you do not wish to resolve
      disputes with McAlister’s through arbitration. Either way, McAlister’s
      will not take any decision you make personally. In fact, McAlister’s
      promises that your decision to opt-out of this Arbitration Provision will
      have no adverse effect on your relationship with McAlister’s. But,
      McAlister’s does have to enforce the Opt-Out Deadline so keep in mind
      that any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be
      valid and you must pursue your dispute in arbitration or small claims
      court.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2>Arbitration procedures</h2>
    <p>
      If this Provision applies and the dispute is not resolved as provided
      above (Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution) either you or McAlister’s may
      initiate arbitration proceedings with either the American Arbitration
      Association (“AAA”), www.adr.org, or JAMS, www.jamsadr.com. AAA or JAMS
      will arbitrate all disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before
      a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be commenced as an individual
      arbitration only, and shall in no event be commenced as a class
      arbitration or a consolidated or representative action or arbitration. All
      issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this
      Provision.
    </p>
    <p>
      For arbitration before AAA, for Disputes of less than $75,000, the AAA’s
      Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes that are in effect
      at the time the arbitration is initiated will apply; for Disputes
      involving $75,000 or more, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules that are
      in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated will apply. In either
      instance, the AAA’s Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection
      that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated shall apply.
      The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling <a href="tel:18007787879">1-800-778-7879</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules
      &amp; Procedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery Protocols
      For Domestic, Commercial Cases that are in effect at the time the
      arbitration is initiated will apply. The JAMS rules are available at
      www.jamsadr.com or by calling <a href="tel:18003525267">1-800-352-5267</a>. This Provision governs in
      the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules. Under no
      circumstances will class action or representative procedures or rules
      apply to the arbitration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the McAlister’s Rewards Program and these Terms and Conditions
      concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs
      the arbitrability of all disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply
      applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable
      statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Arbitration Award</strong> - The arbitrator may award on an
      individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable
      law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the
      benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The arbitrator
      will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons
      unless requested by a party or if required by applicable law. Such award
      will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal
      provided by the FAA or other applicable law, and may be entered in any
      court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.
      You and McAlister’s understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration
      provision, you and McAlister’s would have the right to sue in court and
      have a jury trial. You and McAlister’s further understand that, in some
      instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation
      in court and the right of discovery may be more limited in arbitration
      than in court.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Confidentiality of Arbitration Proceedings</strong> - Arbitration
      proceedings conducted pursuant to this Section 5 shall be strictly
      confidential. The fact that an arbitration exists or is proceeding,
      <em>the nature of the Dispute, all documents exchanged in connection with
        the arbitration, all testimony (including transcripts of testimony, if
        any) that is given in the arbitration proceeding, and any arbitration
        award shall remain confidential. The only exceptions to this
        confidentiality provision are disclosures reasonably necessary to
        confirm or vacate an arbitration award, a judicial challenge to an
        arbitration award or its enforcement, or disclosure that is required by
        operation of law or court order; provided, however, that this Paragraph
        shall not prevent the disclosure of such information (1) as may be
        required to your legal and financial advisors and independent
        accountants; (2) as may be required to any ME Entity’s (a) legal,
        financial and other professional advisors, regulators, rating agencies,
        independent accountants, analysts, agents, and/or directors, (b)
        shareholders and/or affiliates and their respective officers, directors
        and legal, financial and other professional advisors, and/or (c)
        existing or potential insurers or reinsurers, existing or potential
        investors, existing or potential lenders, or existing or potential
        purchasers; and/or (3) as otherwise required to comply with any
        applicable law or regulation</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Location of Arbitration</strong> - You or McAlister’s may initiate
      arbitration in either Atlanta, Georgia or the Unites States county in
      which you reside. In the event that you select the county of your United
      States residence, McAlister’s may transfer the arbitration to Atlanta,
      Georgia in the event it agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you
      incur as a result of the change in the arbitration location as determined
      by the arbitrator.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs</strong> - So long as you
      place a request in writing prior to commencement of the arbitration,
      McAlister’s will pay all arbitration filing fees and AAA or JAMS hearing
      fees and any arbitrator's hearing fees, costs and expenses upon your
      written request to the arbitrator given at or before the first evidentiary
      hearing in the arbitration. But, you will still be responsible for all
      additional fees and costs that you incur in the arbitration which include
      but are not limited to attorneys’ fees or expert witnesses, unless
      McAlister’s is otherwise specifically required to pay such fees under
      applicable law. In addition to any fees and costs recoverable under
      applicable law, if you provide notice and negotiate in good faith with
      McAlister’s as provided in the section above titled “Pre-Arbitration Claim
      Resolution” and the arbitrator concludes that you are the prevailing party
      in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s
      fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2>Class action waiver</h2>
    <p>
      PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL
      RIGHTS. Except as otherwise provided in this Provision, the arbitrator may
      not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise
      preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims
      (such as a class action, consolidated action, representative action, or
      private attorney general action) unless both you and McAlister’s
      specifically agree to do so in writing following initiation of the
      arbitration. If you choose to pursue your Dispute in court by opting out
      of the Arbitration Provision, as specified above, this Class Action Waiver
      will not apply to you. Neither you, nor any other participant in the
      McAlister’s Rewards Program can be a class representative, class member,
      or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative
      proceeding without having complied with the opt-out requirements above.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2>Jury waiver</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTS YOUR
        LEGAL RIGHTS. You understand and agree that by accepting this Provision
        in these Terms and Conditions, you and McAlister’s are each waiving the
        right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court, to
        the fullest extent allowed by law. In the absence of this Provision, you
        and McAlister’s might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring
        disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be
        represented in a case filed in court by others (including class
        actions). Except as otherwise provided below, those rights are waived.
        Other rights that you would have if you went to court (e.g., the rights
        to both appeal and certain types of discovery) may be more limited or
        may also be waived.</strong>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2>Severability</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>If any clause within this Provision (other than the Class Action Waiver
        clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will
        be severed from this Provision whose remainder will be given full force
        and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or
        unenforceable, this entire Provision will be unenforceable and the
        dispute will be decided by a court and you and McAlisters’ each agree to
        waive in that instance, to the fullest extent allowed by law, any trial
        by jury as set forth above.</strong>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2>Continuation</h2>
    <p>
      This Provision shall survive the termination of your account with
      McAlister’s and your discontinued participation in the McAlister’s Rewards
      Program. Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms and Conditions to
      the contrary, McAlister’s agrees that if McAlister’s makes any change to
      this Provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject
      any such change and require McAlister’s to adhere to the present language
      in this Provision if a dispute between the parties hereto arises.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        The parties agree that the laws of the State of Georgia, United States
        of America, governs these terms and conditions and any dispute between
        you and mcalister’s, irrespective of where the membership application
        was completed or where the member resides or the choice of law
        principles of Georgia or any other jurisdiction.
      </strong>
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Continuation</h2>
<p>
  All or any of McAlister’s rights and obligations hereunder may be assigned to
  a subsequent owner or operator of this App in a merger, acquisition or sale of
  all or substantially all of McAlister’s assets. If, for any reason, a court of
  competent jurisdiction finally determines any provision of these Terms and
  Conditions or any portion thereof to be unenforceable, such provision will be
  enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to give the intended effect
  thereof, and the remainder of these Terms and Conditions will continue in full
  force and effect. McAlister’s failure to act with respect to a breach by you
  or others does not waive McAlister’s right to act with respect to that breach
  or subsequent or similar breaches.
</p>
<p>
  These Terms and Conditions, and all Terms and Conditions incorporated herein
  by reference, represent the entire agreement between you and McAlister’s with
  respect to the McAlister’s Rewards Program or any program benefits. The Terms
  and Conditions may not be modified except by publication of modified Terms and
  Conditions by McAlister’s on
  <strong>this terms and conditions page</strong>.
