    collectively, the “Apps”) owned or operated by McAlister’s Franchisor SPV
    LLC or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries (collectively, “McAlister’s”)

    “Service” and collectively, the “Services”).
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  AGREEMENT TO TERMS AND CONDITIONS BY USER
</p>
<p>
  By using the Sites, Apps, and Services, you acknowledge and accept without
  limitation or qualification, these terms, conditions, and notices (“Terms and
  Conditions”), the terms and conditions for each Site, App and/or Service, our

    User Generated Terms and Conditions
  </a>
  , our
  <a href="privacy/cookies.html">Cookie Policy</a>, and
  our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, each
  of which is incorporated herein by reference.
</p>
<p>
  McAlister’s reserves the right to change these Terms and Conditions at any
  time and in its sole discretion. The modified Terms and Conditions will be
  effective immediately upon posting and you agree to the new posted Terms and
  Conditions by continuing your use of the Sites, Apps, and Services. It is your
  responsibility to check periodically for any changes we may make to these
  Terms and Conditions.
</p>
<p>
  Each time you use the Sites, Apps, and Services, you reaffirm your acceptance
  of the then-current Terms and Conditions. If you do not wish to be bound by
  these Terms and Conditions, your only remedy is to discontinue using the
  Sites, Apps, and Services. By using the Sites, Apps, and Services, you also
  accept that any prior agreements between you and McAlister’s regarding your
  use of the Sites, Apps, and Services are hereby superseded.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  The Sites and Apps may contain links to other websites and mobile applications
  ("Linked Sites"). The Linked Sites are not under the control of McAlister’s,
  and McAlister’s is not responsible for the contents of any Linked Site,
  including, without limitation, any link contained in a Linked Site, or any
  changes or updates to a Linked Site. McAlister’s is not responsible for
  webcasting or any other form of transmission received from any Linked Site.
  McAlister’s is providing these links to you only as a convenience, and the
  inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by McAlister’s of the Linked
  Site or any association with its operators.
</p>
<p>
  RESTRICTIONS ON USE
</p>
<p>
  You should assume that everything you see or read on the Sites and Apps is
  copyrighted unless otherwise noted, and may not be used except as provided in
  these Terms and Conditions.
</p>
<p>
  Material from the Sites and Apps may not be copied, distributed, republished,
  modified, uploaded, incorporated, posted, or transmitted in any way, without
  the prior written consent of McAlister’s, except that you may print, display,
  or download content from the Sites and Apps for your personal, non-commercial
  use only, provided you do not delete or change any copyright, trademark, or
  other proprietary notices. The material on the Sites and Apps is provided for
  lawful purposes only. No intellectual property rights are licensed or
  transferred to you through your use of the Sites, Apps, and Services, but
  remain with McAlister’s, who owns full and complete title to all intellectual
  property in connection with the Sites, Apps, and Services. You may not resell,
  decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or otherwise convert the Sites or
  Apps and any content thereon.
</p>
<p>
  Linking, or any other manner of incorporating the whole or parts of the Sites
  and Apps, including the framing of Sites and Apps by sites or site elements
  controlled by third parties, is strictly prohibited.
</p>
<p>
  NO UNLAWFUL OR PROHIBITED USE
</p>
<p>
  As a condition of your use of the Sites, Apps, and Services, you warrant to
  McAlister’s that you will not use the Sites, Apps, and Services for any
  purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by these terms, conditions, and
  notices. You may not use the Sites, Apps, and Services in any manner which

  Services. You may not obtain or attempt to obtain any materials or information
  through any means not intentionally made available or provided for through the
  Sites, Apps, and Services.
</p>
<p>
  You need not register with McAlister’s to simply visit and view the Sites and
  use many of the Services available on the Sites. However, McAlister’s may from
  time to time require you to register for an account in order to access certain
  password-restricted areas of the Sites and Apps and to use certain Services
  and materials offered on and through the Sites and Apps. McAlister’s shall
  have the right to approve or reject any requested account, in McAlister’s
  discretion. If your account is approved, you will be permitted to log in to
  the applicable Site, App, or Service using the password you select. You may
  not permit anyone other than yourself to use your username or password to gain
  access to the Site, App, or Service. You will take reasonable steps to
  maintain the privacy of your username and password and to prevent unauthorized
  access to or disclosure of your username and password. You are responsible for
  all activities that occur using your username and password
</p>
<p>
  COMMUNICATION SERVICES; SUBMISSIONS AND UNAUTHORIZED CONDUCT
</p>
<p>
  The Sites and Apps may contain bulletin board services, chat areas, news
  groups, forums, communities, personal web pages, calendars, and/or other
  message or communication facilities designed to enable you to communicate with
  McAlister’s, the public at large, or within a group (collectively,
  "Communication Services"). As used in these Terms and Conditions, the term
  Services shall include Communication Services. You agree to use the
  Communication Services only to post, send, and receive messages and material
  that are proper and related to the particular Communication Service.
</p>
<p>
  All remarks, suggestions, ideas, graphics, discussions, chats, postings,
  transmissions, bulletin boards, or other information communicated to
  McAlister’s through the Sites and Apps, via the Communication Services or
  otherwise (each, a "Submission"), will forever be the property of McAlister’s,
  except as otherwise expressly stated by McAlister’s in connection with a
  specific Submission. McAlister’s will treat any Submission as nonproprietary
  and non-confidential. By posting, uploading, inputting, providing, or
  submitting your Submission you acknowledge that you and not McAlister’s have
  full responsibility for the message, including its legality, reliability,
  appropriateness, originality, and copyright. You further warrant and represent
  that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to your Submission as
  described in this section including, without limitation, all the rights
  necessary for you to provide, post, upload, input, or submit the Submissions.
  Except as otherwise expressly stated by McAlister’s in connection with a
  specific Submission, anything you transmit or post becomes the property of
  McAlister’s and may be used for any purpose, including, but not limited to,
  reproduction, disclosure, transmission, publication, broadcast, posting, or
  marketing.
</p>
<p>
  No compensation will be paid with respect to the use of your Submission, as
  provided herein. McAlister’s is under no obligation to post or use any
  Submission you may provide and may, in McAlister’s sole discretion, remove any
  Submission at any time, for any reason, without notice to you.
</p>
<p>
  McAlister’s may from time to time monitor Submissions on the Sites, Apps and
  Communication Services; however, McAlister’s is under no obligation to do so.
  McAlister’s assumes no responsibility or liability arising from the content of
  any such Submissions, nor for any error, defamation, libel, slander, omission,
  falsehood, obscenity, pornography, profanity, danger, or inaccuracy contained
  in any information within such locations on the Sites or Apps, including in
  Submissions. You are strictly prohibited from posting or transmitting any
  unlawful, threatening, libelous, defamatory, obscene, scandalous,
  inflammatory, pornographic, or profane material or any material that could
  constitute or encourage conduct that would be considered a criminal offense,
  give rise to civil liability, or otherwise violate any law. McAlister’s will
  fully cooperate with any law enforcement authorities or court order requesting
  or directing McAlister’s to disclose the identity of anyone posting any such
  information or materials.
</p>
<p>
  When using the Sites, Apps, and/or Services and/or making a Submission, you
  agree to abide by common standards of decency and act in accordance with the
  law. By way of example and not limitation, you agree not to:

    rights (such as rights of privacy and publicity) of others.
  </li>
  <li>
    Publish, post, upload, distribute, or disseminate any inappropriate,
    profane, defamatory, infringing, obscene, indecent or unlawful topic, name,
    material, or information.

    intellectual property laws (or by rights of privacy of publicity) unless you
    own or control the rights thereto or have received all necessary consents.
  </li>
  <li>
    Upload files that contain viruses, corrupted files, or any other similar
    software or programs that may damage the operation of the Sites, Apps, or
    Services, or another's computer.
  </li>
  <li>
    Advertise or offer to sell or buy any goods or services for any business
    purpose, unless such Site, App, or Service specifically allows such
    messages.
  </li>
  <li>
    Conduct or forward surveys, contests, pyramid schemes, or chain letters.
  </li>
  <li>
    Download any file posted by another user of a Site, App, or Service that you
    know, or reasonably should know, cannot be legally distributed in such
    manner.
  </li>
  <li>
    Falsify or delete any author attributions, legal or other proper notices, or
    proprietary designations or labels of the origin or source of software or
    other material contained in a file that is uploaded.

  <li>
    Restrict or inhibit any other user from using and enjoying the Sites, Apps,
    Services, or any part thereof.

  Submissions and to remove any materials at any time, for any reason, without
  notice to you. McAlister’s reserves the right to terminate your access to any
  or all of the Sites, Apps, or Services at any time without notice for any
  reason whatsoever.
</p>
<p>
  McAlister’s reserves the right at all times to disclose any information as
  necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or
  governmental request, or to edit, refuse to post, or to remove any information
  or materials, in whole or in part, in McAlister’s sole discretion.
</p>
<p>
  Always use caution when giving out any personally identifying information
  about yourself or your children on or through the Sites, Apps, or Services.

  found in any Communication Service. Therefore, McAlister’s specifically
  disclaims any liability with regard to the Communication Services and any
  actions resulting from your participation in any Communication Service.

<p>
  These Terms and Conditions will be governed and be interpreted pursuant to the

  principles of conflicts of law, and you hereby consent to the exclusive
  jurisdiction and venue of courts in Georgia in all disputes arising out of or
  relating to the use of the Sites, Apps, and Services. Use of the Sites, Apps,

  all provisions of these terms and conditions, including without limitation
  this paragraph. You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or
  agency relationship exists between you and McAlister’s as a result of these
  Terms and Conditions or use of the Sites, Apps and/or Services. McAlister’s
  performance of this Terms and Conditions is subject to existing laws and legal

  of McAlister’s right to comply with governmental, court, and law enforcement
  requests or requirements relating to your use of the Sites, Apps, and Services
  or information provided to or gathered by McAlister’s with respect to such
  use. If any part of these Terms and Conditions is determined to be invalid or
  unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the
  warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the
  invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid,
  enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original
  provision and the remainder of these Terms and Conditions shall continue in
  effect. Unless otherwise specified herein or agreed to by you, these Terms and
  Conditions, together with all other policies, guidelines, agreements, terms
  and conditions referenced herein, constitute the entire agreement between you
  and McAlister’s with respect to the Sites, Apps, and Services. A printed

  the same conditions as other business documents and records originally
  generated and maintained in printed form. McAlister’s products and Services
  are available in many parts of the world. However, the Sites and Apps may
